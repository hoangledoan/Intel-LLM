[ WARNING ] It is recommended to set the environment variable OMP_WAIT_POLICY to PASSIVE, so that OpenVINO inference can use all CPU resources without waiting.

[ INFO ] [warm-up][P0] Input text: It's done, and submitted. You can play 'Survival of the Tastiest' on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multiple touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing. There is a lot I'd like to talk about. I will go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list. Concept Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks which I had to face. Originally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise

I wanted to make a game that would be fun, and that would be different from the usual mobile games. I wanted to make something that would stand out, and that would be remembered. After a few days of brainstorming, I finally came up with the idea of a food-based survival game. The game would be set in a world where food is the only source of energy, and where the player would have to collect, craft, and cook
