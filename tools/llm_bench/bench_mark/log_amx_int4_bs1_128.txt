[ WARNING ] It is recommended to set the environment variable OMP_WAIT_POLICY to PASSIVE, so that OpenVINO inference can use all CPU resources without waiting.

[ INFO ] [warm-up][P0] Input text: It's done, and submitted. You can play 'Survival of the Tastiest' on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multiple touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing. There is a lot I'd like to talk about. I will go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list. Concept Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks which I had to face. Originally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise

The idea of surviving in a world where food is the only thing that matters, and where you have to fight to survive, was something that I found interesting. The gameplay mechanics were easy to come up with, but the theme was something that I had to work on

It was a lot of work, but I'm glad I did it, because the game is much better now. Gameplay Mechanics The gameplay mechanics were a bit tricky to get right.
