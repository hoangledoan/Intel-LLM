<frozen importlib.util>:208: DeprecationWarning: The `openvino.runtime` module is deprecated and will be removed in the 2026.0 release. Please replace `openvino.runtime` with `openvino`.
[ INFO ] ==SUCCESS FOUND==: use_case: text_gen, model_type: llama
[ INFO ] OV Config={'INFERENCE_NUM_THREADS': 160, 'CACHE_DIR': ''}
[ WARNING ] It is recommended to set the environment variable OMP_WAIT_POLICY to PASSIVE, so that OpenVINO inference can use all CPU resources without waiting.
[ INFO ] The num_beams is 1, update Torch thread num from 80 to 16, avoid to use the CPU cores for OpenVINO inference.

[ INFO ] [warm-up][P0] Input text: It's done, and submitted. You can play 'Survival of the Tastiest' on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multiple touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing. There is a lot I'd like to talk about. I will go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list. Concept Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks which I had to face. Originally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise
