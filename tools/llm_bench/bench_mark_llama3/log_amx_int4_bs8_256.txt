[ WARNING ] It is recommended to set the environment variable OMP_WAIT_POLICY to PASSIVE, so that OpenVINO inference can use all CPU resources without waiting.
[ INFO ] The num_beams is 1, update Torch thread num from 80 to 16, avoid to use the CPU cores for OpenVINO inference.

[ INFO ] [warm-up][P0] Input text: It is done, and submitted. You can play 'Survival of the Tastiest' on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multiple touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing. There is a lot I'd like to talk about. I will go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list. Concept Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks which I had to face. Originally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise - something with a lot of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident that I could fit any theme around it. In the end, the problem with a theme like 'Evolution' in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game? In a game, you need to control something to reach an objective
