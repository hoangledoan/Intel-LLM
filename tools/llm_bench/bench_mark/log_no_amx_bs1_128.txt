[ INFO ] OV Config={'INFERENCE_NUM_THREADS': 160, 'CACHE_DIR': ''}
[ WARNING ] It is recommended to set the environment variable OMP_WAIT_POLICY to PASSIVE, so that OpenVINO inference can use all CPU resources without waiting.
[ INFO ] The num_beams is 1, update Torch thread num from 80 to 16, avoid to use the CPU cores for OpenVINO inference.

[ INFO ] [warm-up][P0] Input text: It's done, and submitted. You can play 'Survival of the Tastiest' on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multiple touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing. There is a lot I'd like to talk about. I will go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list. Concept Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks which I had to face. Originally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise

The game is a puzzle game, where you have to move tiles around to create a path for the food to reach the hungry monster. The game is meant to be easy to learn, but hard to master. The gameplay is simple, but it requires strategy to solve the puzzles. The game is also meant to be fun, and enjoyable, and I think I achieved that. Design The design of the game was a bit tricky, as I wanted to
